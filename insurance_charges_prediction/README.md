# Insurance Charges: Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictions with R

This project aims to perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on various variables related to insurance charges, examine their distributions, and correlations, and build a linear regression model to predict these charges accurately. Furthermore, we aim to improve the model's performance with up to 86% accuracy through various techniques.

This repository holds data used for the project, Jupyter Notebook, and R script.
