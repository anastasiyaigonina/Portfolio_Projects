# Reviews: Sentiment, Topic Modeling, Clustering with Python
The main components of this project are as follows:
* Data analysis: Exploratory analysis of the hotel reviews dataset to gain insights and understand the characteristics of the data.
* Sentiment analysis: Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the hotel reviews using natural language processing techniques.
* Prediction model: Building a machine learning model to predict the sentiment of new hotel reviews based on the analysis performed.
* Topic modeling: Identifying key topics or themes within the hotel reviews dataset using topic modeling algorithms and visualizing them interactively.
* Negative reviews clustering: Grouping negative reviews into clusters based on their similarity to identify common issues or problems faced by customers.
