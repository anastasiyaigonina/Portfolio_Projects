It involves data preparation and cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive models to forecast customer spending based on various variables. Furthermore, the project explores the correlation between total revenue and currency rates.


## [Diabetes: EDA, hypothesis testing, predictions with Python](https://github.com/igonina-anastasi/Portfolio_Projects/tree/main/diabetes_hypothesis_predictions)

This project focuses on the analysis of diabetes medical data and building predictive models to predict diabetes status. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, observations, and the development of various models to predict the presence or absence of diabetes.

## [Reviews: Sentiment, Topic Modeling, Clustering with Python](https://github.com/igonina-anastasi/Portfolio_Projects/tree/main/reviews_sentiment_topic_modeling)

This project focuses on analyzing hotel reviews using data analysis techniques, sentiment analysis, prediction modeling, topic modeling, and negative reviews clustering. The goal is to gain insights from the reviews, predict sentiment, identify key topics, and group similar negative reviews. The findings contribute to improving customer satisfaction and decision-making processes in the hotel industry.

## [Cyclistic Case Study: Data Analysis with R](https://github.com/igonina-anastasi/Portfolio_Projects/tree/main/cyclistic_case_study_r)

This project aims to provide valuable insights and recommendations for a bike-sharing company based on a thorough data analysis process. By following the data analysis process, including asking questions, preparing the data, processing and analyzing it, sharing the findings, and suggesting actions, we have uncovered valuable information to support business decision-making.

## [Insurance Charges: Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictions with R](https://github.com/igonina-anastasi/Portfolio_Projects/tree/main/insurance_charges_prediction)

This project aims to perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on various variables related to insurance charges, examine their distributions, and correlations, and build a linear regression model to predict these charges accurately. Furthermore, we aim to improve the model's performance with up to 86% accuracy through various techniques.

## [Real Estate Data Analysis using SQL](https://github.com/igonina-anastasi/Portfolio_Projects/tree/main/real_estate_data_analysis_sql)

This project aims to analyze real estate data in the USA using SQL and create an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize the insights.
